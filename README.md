# Caliditas
A diploma-project repository.

Our project shall take measured values from a sauna controller and generate a picture for easy display in the sauna.
The aim of this project is to replace the, usually inaccurate and unreliable, mechanical thermometers mounted on the inside of the saua cabin.

This project is a part of our diploma verification process and is being conducted by students of a Higher Technical College called "HTL Rennweg" in Vienna, Austria.
